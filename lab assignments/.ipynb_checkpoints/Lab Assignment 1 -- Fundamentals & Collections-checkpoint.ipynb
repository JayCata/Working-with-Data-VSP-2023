    "## Exercise 1 -- Jupyter Markdown Basics\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks allows cells to be interpreted as either code or Markdown. Markdown is a lightweight formatting language. In fact, what you're reading right now is written in Markdown. The syntax is very simple and a reference for common commands can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Use this reference guide to complete the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a cell below this one by using the insert drop down menu or by clicking on the left of this box (so the side bar turns blue) and tapping the <kbd>b</kbd> key.\n",
    "2. Make the cell a Markdown cell by clicking on it and using the drop down menu above.\n",
    "3. Using the reference guide, find out how to create the **smallest** heading  and use it give the cell you create a header of \"Solution to Exercise 1\" without the quotes.\n",
    "4. Using the reference guide, figure out how to make ordered and unordered lists. Using an unordered list, list three of the things you hope to learn from this class.\n",
    "5. Sometimes, we want to reference specific code or code objects in the text of Markdown. Markdown allows us to format such reference so that it appears in a gray box (e.g. `x=3`). Using the reference guide, figure out how to format code and format  x = 3, so it has a gray box around it in the cell you created. "
